# Pok√©mon Center Queue Position Viewer

This Chrome extension reveals your **current queue position** and **estimated wait time** while waiting in line on [PokemonCenter.com](https://www.pokemoncenter.com).

When high-demand product drops occur, Pok√©mon Center places users in a virtual queue. While the backend tracks your position, the site doesn't display it. This extension makes that hidden information visible ‚Äî so you‚Äôre no longer left in the dark about how far you have to go.

## üîç What It Does

The Pok√©mon Center site already updates your queue position using JavaScript. However, the element that holds the position (`#position`) is **not rendered**. This extension:

1. **Adds a missing DOM element** that Pok√©mon Center's script will update with your current position.
2. **Observes changes** to that position.
3. **Displays your queue position** and an **estimated time remaining** based on how quickly your position is moving.

You‚Äôll see this information right on the queue screen, updating automatically.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Insert Hidden Element**: When the extension detects that you're in the queue, it adds a hidden `<span id="position">` element to the page. Pok√©mon Center‚Äôs existing code starts updating this span with your position number.
  
- **Render Display Elements**: The extension also adds two visible UI elements:
  - A message like `You are currently in position 3,402.`
  - An estimate like `Remaining time in queue: 12 minutes, 8 seconds`

- **Track Position Over Time**: It keeps a time-stamped history of your previous positions.
  - When your position updates, it calculates how long it took to move and estimates how long you have left.
  - The estimate improves the longer you stay in queue.
